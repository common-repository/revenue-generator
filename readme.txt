Monetize your blog and your content with the Revenue Generator. We offer a frictionless transaction experience that helps you increase your revenue streams, conversion rates and online customer interactions.

== Description ==

= Overview =
The Revenue Generator plugin is a content monetization solution for your WordPress page. Our flexible paywall enables you to request contributions from your followers or sell individual pieces of content, timed access, or recurring subscriptions to your site.

Our unique ‘pay later’ model takes the upfront friction out of the transaction and allows your users to access content instantly by agreeing to pay for it later.

You can offer content priced as low as $0.05 and audiences can purchase that content with just a click or two – without having to provide payment until they reach a $5 threshold on their tab. At this point, we ask them to pay and have found that about 85% of users will do so.

Although we recommend using the ‘pay later’ model of the paywall because of the results mentioned above, you are, of course, free to choose the ‘pay now’ model if it better suits your needs. [Read more about the difference between ‘pay later’ and ‘pay now’](https://www.laterpay.net/academy/getting-started-with-laterpay-the-difference-between-pay-now-pay-later).

The Revenue Generator plugin is easy to implement and offers a user interface that gives you complete control over your paywall and pricing.
